<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The long term preservation of digital records is much more problematic than the long term preservation of, for instance, paper records. Xena is part of the National Archives' approach to overcome these problems.</p>

<h3>Hardware obsolescence</h3>
<p>Hardware and media formats become obsolete over time. A good example is floppy disks, 8" and 5.25" floppy disks were replaced by 3.5" disks, which are in turn now being replaced by CD-R technology. A similar process has occurred with computers themselves; newer processors have replaced older ones. Old equipment needed to read obsolete media cannot be maintained indefinitely. Any digital preservation strategy must take account of these issues. The National Archives' digital preservation strategy does, however this solution does not involve Xena.</p>

<h3>Media degradation</h3>
<p>Media degradation is another well understood issue &#8211; the media on which records are stored degrades over time. This is also an issue for non-digital records; however the timespan over which digital media degrades is often much shorter than for non-digital media such as paper or film. The usual strategy for dealing with media degradation is to migrate the records to new media on a regular basis. Xena is not part of this process.</p>

<h3>Software obsolescence</h3>
<p>Xena is designed to overcome software obsolescence. Software obsolescence arises from the continual upgrade of computer software; newer, more powerful versions of software replace older versions' file formats. Unfortunately, newer versions of the software can't always read the older versions. In the long term many, if not most, data formats will no longer be able to be read by any computer program. As support is usually withdrawn for obsolete software versions, and there is no guarantee that the company that produced the software will still exist, there needs to be a way of dealing with this issue. Xena does this through the process of <b>normalisation.</b><p>

<h3>Normalisation</h3>

<p>In Xena, normalisation is the conversion of a digital record from its original format into an archival XML equivalent. Xena can also create an XML wrapped base64 version of the record. This is referred to as <b>XML wrapping</b>.</p>

<p>The base64 version, which is also known as the original bitstream version, enables us to conserve the digital record in its original format as a binary object. This is important if we cannot normalise the record straight away. Furthermore if we wish to normalise the record again using a different normalisation path, then we can do so from the original record. It is not possible to reverse the normalisation process, whereas it is possible to reverse the XML wrapping process, converting the record from base64 back to the original data format. Wrapping also promotes authenticity. If someone wishes to question the authenticity of the normalised version, we can provide them with the original record and the normalisation tools, or they can build the tools necessary to view the record in its original format.</p>

<p>Xena creates the normalised version of a digital record by converting the original data object into an XML format. This format will vary, depending on the format of the original record, and what is the essence of that record. In all cases the XML format will be open source. For more information on essence and normalisation, see the National Archives Green Paper: <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/recordkeeping/er/digital_preservation/summary.html">An Approach to the Preservation of Digital Records</a>.</p>
