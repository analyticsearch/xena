<h1>Formats Xena can normalise</h1>

<p>Xena's ability to normalise documents is provided by the use of plugins. Each plugin enables Xena to normalise one or more data formats. Some plugins use third party software such as OpenOffice.org.</p>

<p>Below is a sample of the record types that Xena can currently normalise. For a definitive list, see the documentation on the individual plugins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Excel 5.0/95/97/2000</li>
<li>Microsoft Word 6.0/95/97/2000</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint 97/2000</li>
<li>ASCII text documents with Unix, Windows, or MacOS line endings</li>
<li>Simple HTML documents</li>
<li>JPEG, GIF, TIFF and BMP images</li>
<li>CSV files</li>
<li>Email messages</li>
<li>Email boxes</li>
</ul>


<p>The following formats have been tested and Xena cannot currently normalise them. When asked to normalise them it will treat them as binary objects and XML wrap the files. It is intended that future releases of Xena will be able to normalise these formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF documents</li>
<li>PCX images</li>
</ul>

<p>As it is an open source application, any user of Xena may write a normalisation path for a new data format.</p>
