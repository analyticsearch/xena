<h2>Design of Xena</h2>
<p>Xena is a Java based open source application developed by the National Archives of Australia (NAA) under the GNU Public License (GPL). This development model was chosen to increase the ability of Xena to be used in the long term preservation of electronic records.</p>

<p>As it is Java based, Xena can run on any operating system that can run Java. The total Java environment is fully documented and specified. As anyone can build a Java runtime environment, and Java is widely used, it is highly likely to remain viable for many years. If it ever does become obsolete, there is a very high degree of probability that there will be clear and effective migration paths to replace any application running on a Java platform. This increases the ability of Xena to avoid operating system and hardware obsolescence. If you can run Java, or migrate from a Java platform, you can run Xena.</p>

<p>As an open source application, the source code for Xena is publicly available. This means that while the National Archives will continue to make a significant investment in enhancing and maintaining Xena, other organisations and users can adapt Xena to their needs. The National Archives hopes that this will lead to a community of Xena users and developers which will be able improve Xena and expand its capabilities to deal with new electronic record formats and electronic recordkeeping environments.</p>

<h3>Functional design</h3>

<p>Xena is designed to operate as a component of the NAA preservation strategy and workflow; it has many automatic settings and automated processes set for the NAA electronic records preservation workflow. For more information see <a href="Background.html">Background</a>. </p>

<p>The two most important automated settings within Xena that result from this are the default destination folder file naming for normalised records, and the default XML metadata wrapping normalised XML. However because Xena is an open source application, users can easily customise Xena to change these automated settings. It is also possible that these default settings will change as the National Archives further investigates digital records preservation.</p>

<p>Xena is a digital preservation tool, converting files into preservation formats: both an XML wrapped base64 version of the original binary file, and a normalised version. These concepts are discussed in <a href="method.html">How Xena preserves records</a>.</p>

<h3>Technical design</h3>

<p>Xena is designed around a central core program, with plugins used to normalise digital records. It is these plugins that allow it to expand to deal with new data formats.</p>

<p>Each plugin can normalise one or more data formats. The Image plugin, for instance, is designed to normalise most image files (such as JPEG, TIFF, GIF and BMP) into PNG image files. The plaintext plugin, on the other hand, is designed to normalise unformatted text files from different platforms (such as Windows, Unix, and MacOS) that use different character sets. As the need arises to normalise new data formats, new plugins can be developed. Because Xena is open source, anyone can develop new plugins, which is especially important for rare or specialised data formats.</p>

<p>Some plugins rely on third party software. The Office plugin relies on OpenOffice.org, an open source
office productivity suite. This reliance on third party software may be for the actual normalisation process, as with the Office plugin, or it may be for some pre-normalisation treatment; for example, PDF files. The path for normalising PDF is to convert it to a directory of images using Adobe Acrobat Writer, then to normalise
the directory of images using the multipage plugin which does not require third party software.</p>
 

<h3><a name="architecture">How Xena preserves digital records</a></h3>

<p>This section describes some architectural aspects of how Xena preserves digital records. It covers the basic concepts underlying the normalisation of digital records and their display, expressed in the programming of the Xena plugins.</p>

<p>The Xena modules that normalise data into XML are called <b>normalisers</b>. Each plugin carries one or more normalisers. A normaliser accepts a data object, which is usually a single digital file such as an image or a Word document, and converts it into an XML version of that data object, depending on the programming of the
normaliser. The output is in the form of a XenaFileType.</p>

<p>Xena plugins include guesser modules to decide which normalisers to use. These modules check if a data object conforms to a particular type &#150; such as a JPEG image, or plain text document &#150; based on numerous factors, including file extension and the data it contains. Xena passes the data object by each guesser in turn. The guessers respond with the probability that the data object is of a particular data format. Xena then examines these results, and offers the user what it thinks is the most appropriate normaliser as the first option. This is why, when normalising a single data object, you will be offered a list of file type names such as String, Binary and HTML, so that you can confirm to Xena the actual file type of the document.</p>

<p>FileTypes are conceptual notions that represent a particular data format. XenaFileTypes are a subset of FileTypes representing the Xena XML formats. A FileType can have multiple normalisers, each producing a different XML version of the original data object.</p>

<p>Once a data object has been normalised and saved to a file, when it is later opened the guessers will recognise it as a XenaFileType, and Xena will offer that as the primary choice. The Xena Viewers will then present the XenaFileType to the user. A XenaFileType may have multiple views; for example, a preserved image file may be displayed within Xena as an image. It can also be viewed as raw XML, or in the form of an XML tree. More complex file types, such as multimedia files, will have more views available.</p>
