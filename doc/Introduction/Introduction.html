<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
<p>Xena is designed to assist in the long-term preservation of electronic records. It is capable of converting records from their original data formats into open, fully documented formats designed for archival use, then presenting these converted records to users at a later date. It does this through a process called "normalisation".</p>


<p>The long-term preservation of electronic records poses several well known problems. One of these problems is software obsolescence. Over time, older data formats are replaced with newer data formats and there is no guarantee that we will be able to read files created in these older formats. Newer versions of software replace older versions, creating changes to data formats, even if the name of the format remains the same. Similarly, a software company may go out of business, leaving the proprietary data formats unsupported and thus unreadable within a very short space of time.</p>

<p>Xena is designed to overcome the problem of software obsolescence by converting or normalising documents into a vendor neutral open source format based on XML.</P>

<p>As well as converting electronic records into a preservation format, Xena can be used to view or "present" normalised electronic records. We use the term "present"  because not all records can be viewed, for example a sound file.</p>
