<h2>Who uses Xena?</h2>
<p> Although the National Archives of Australia developed Xena as a digital preservation software application for its own internal use, Xena may be a useful tool for many other institutions, organisations and individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other archival institutions may find Xena useful in developing in-house digital preservation programs.</li>
<li>Government agencies and other organisations may find it useful to integrate Xena into  records management systems so that digital records may be converted to standard formats at the point of capture or to batch convert existing corporate record repositories into standard formats for long-term accessibility and preservation.</li>
<li>Individuals may find Xena useful when needing to move documents across computing platforms, send documents to others, post documents to the World Wide Web or when changing to new versions of software programs that do not support older formats.</li>
</ul>
