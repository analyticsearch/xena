<h2>What is Xena?</h2>
<p>Xena stands for <b>X</b>ML <b>E</b>lectronic <b>N</b>ormalising of <b>A</b>rchives. 
It is a Java based open source application, designed and developed by the National Archives of Australia to assist in the long-term preservation of digital records.  
With constantly changing hardware and software the challenge was to find a way to preserve valuable digital records into the future.  
Xena does this by converting records from their original data format into a vendor neutral, open source format based on XML that will be able to be read by future technology. 
This process is called Normalisation.</p>

<p>Xena is also able to preserve the original bit stream of a record by converting it into text via a process known as Base64 encoding.  
The converted code, together with its metadata, are then wrapped in XML.  
This is a reversible conversion allowing for the record to be reproduced in its original format if required.  
This process is called XML Wrapping.</p>
