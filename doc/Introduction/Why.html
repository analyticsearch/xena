<h2>Why use Xena?</h2>
<p>Everyday tens of thousands of institutions, organisations and individuals create digital records in a variety of different formats.  
A format is the rules by which the information within a record is organised.  
Software applications then use these rules to process and present the record for viewing.  
However, many of these formats are proprietary and may, in time, become unsupported or unreadable.  
If the original application is no longer available, access to that record might be lost forever.</p>

<p>Xena was designed to overcome software obsolescence.  
It leaves behind the restrictions of a closed, proprietary format by converting digital records into an open source, fully documented format.  
Using open formats means that digital records are more accessible today and stand more chance of remaining accessible over the decades to come.</p>
