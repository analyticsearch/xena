<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>When Xena Lite is used for the first time, the location of the normaliser plugins directory and the location of OpenOffice.org must be specified.</p>
<p>The <b>plugins</b> directory is normally located in the same directory as the xena.jar file.</p>
<p>OpenOffice must be installed if Xena is to normalise office documents. Xena Lite uses a <b>1.1.x</b> version of OpenOffice, which may be downloaded from <a href="http://download.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>.
