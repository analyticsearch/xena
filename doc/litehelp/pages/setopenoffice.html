<h1>Set up OpenOffice</h1>
<p>From the Xena Lite menu, select <b>Tools -&gt; Plugin Preferences -&gt; Office</b>.
</p>
<p><img src="../screens/xlscrn4.jpg"></img>
</p>
<p>Click <b>Browse</b> and navigate to the location of OpenOffice 2.0.x. Office document normalising is more reliable where only a single version of OpenOffice is installed on a computer, so if earlier versions of OpenOffice have been installed they should be removed.

</p>
<p>The sleep time value is set to 5 seconds. This is the length of time that Xena Lite will wait for your computer to start OpenOffice when it is needed for office document conversions. The value may be reduced (perhaps down to just a few seconds) on a fast computer where OpenOffice starts quickly.

<h4>Note for Linux users</h4>
<p>
Some Linux distributions may have a permissions conflict that prevents Xena Lite from recognising the OpenOffice installation. If Xena Lite fails to find OpenOffice on a Linux system, one easy solution is to open a terminal session as the root user and:
<pre>
chown -R &lt;username&gt; /path/to/openoffice/
</pre>
