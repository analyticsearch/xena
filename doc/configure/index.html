<h1>Configuring Xena</h1>

<p>Before using Xena you will need to do some basic configuration. Exactly what needs to be done will depend on your computing environment, but will always include setting the properties and base directories.</p> 

<h3>Setting the Xena properties</h3>

<p>Before using Xena, you must set the properties. This includes choosing a package wrapper and file namer. See
<a href ="set_xena_prop.html">Setting the Xena Properties</a> for instructions.</p>


<h3>Setting the base directories in Xena</h3>

<p>Before normalising a batch of records using Xena, you must set the base directories. See
<a href ="set_base_dir.html">Setting the Base Directories</a> for instructions.</p>


<h3>Xena and operating Systems</h3>

<p>As a Java application Xena is able to run on different operating systems. However, there are operating system specific issues with Xena and these are noted on the folliwng pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="windows.html">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="MacOS.html">Mac OSX</a></li>
<li><a href="Linux.html">Linux</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Plugin specific configuration</h3>

<p>Some plugins require plugin specific configuration or additional software to function properly. For example, the Office plugin requires that OpenOffice.org is installed on the computer and its installation directory is configured in Xena.</p>

<p>Each plugin has an 'About' page that details any specific configuration and software requirements for that plugin. You should read the 'About' page for each plugin before using it to normalise or perform a record.</p>
