<H1>Xena on Windows</H1>

<p>As Xena is a Java application it can run on the Windows operating system. Xena has been thoroughly tested on Windows 2000.</p>

<h3>Swapping between Xena and other applications when the batch processor window is open</h3>

<p>There is an issue when using the batch processor on Windows OS that users should be aware of. As batch processing can take a considerable amount of time, it is common behaviour to switch to another application while batch processing runs in the background. When the user clicks on the Windows taskbar to return to Xena, they are presented with the standard Xena interface, not the batch processing window, and Xena appears to be frozen. </p>
<p>This is not a bug, it is standard behaviour for Java based applications. Xena has not frozen and the batch processor window is still open.</p>
<p>To return to Xena you will need to use the ALT+TAB keys to select Xena. You do this by holding down the ALT key and repeatedly pressing the TAB key until Xena is selected in the pop-up window.</p>
