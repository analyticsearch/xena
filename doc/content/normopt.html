<b>'Guess type for all files'</b>
<ul><li>Xena will determine the type of each file in the selection list and apply the normaliser best suited to that file type. This is the default action.</li></ul>
<b>'Binary normalisation only'</b>
<ul><li>Files are encoded as text (base64 encoded) with an XML metadata header and footer. This process may be applied to any file type and provides a means of preserving the file in its original form with the addition of some contextual metadata.</li></ul>
