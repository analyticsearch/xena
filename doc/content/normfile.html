<h1>Normalise a File</h1>
<p>To normalise a single file, click <b>Add Files</b> from the main window.</p>
<p><img src="../images/01-frontscreen.png"></img></p>
<br>
<p>
Use the file browser to select the file to be normalised, then click <b>Open</b>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/10-add-files.png"></img></p>
<br>
<p>Back at the main window, click the <b>Normalise</b> button to begin the normalising process.</p>

<p>During processing, the <b>Pause</b> and <b>Stop</b> buttons will become available. Please note that rather than halting the process immediately, either of these will interrupt processing once the current file has been processed. If the current file is large or complex, there may be some delay before either of these buttons come into effect.
</p>
<p>
Once processing is completed, the results are presented. Click <b>OK</b>.

<br>
<p>
Upon completion, the <b>Cancel</b> button may be used to delete the resulting Xena file(s) and start again. This may be useful if the wrong file was accidentally normalised. The <b>New Session</b> button may be used after completion to continue processing files without altering any existing results.
</p>
<p>If a file is malformed or is of an unknown type to Xena, then the normalising process may fail. Failures are indicated in the results table with a brief explanation of the cause. If any failures occur, the <b>Binary Normalise Failures</b> button then becomes active and may be used to preserve failed files as text with embedded metadata.
