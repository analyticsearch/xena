<b>Normalise</b>
<ul><li>Start normalising files or directories in the selection list.</li></ul><br>
<b>Pause</b>

<b>Stop</b>
<ul><li>Stop normalising the current list of files. The stop function will not interrupt the processing of the file currently being normalised, but will take effect before starting to process the next file.</li></ul><br>
<b>Resume</b>
<ul><li>The resume button is available when processing has been paused. Resume will continue processing until all selected files have been normalised or until the process is interrupted by pause or stop.</li></ul><br>
<b>Binary Normalise Failures</b>
<ul><li>If a file is damaged or of a type not recognised by Xena, the normalisation process will fail. In order to preserve the file for future treatment, use Binary Normalise Failures to encode the file as text with encapsulated metadata.</li></ul><br>
<b>Cancel</b>
<ul><li>The Cancel button will cause the files created by the current normalising process to be deleted. This is useful if the wrong files have been selected for conversion or if the wrong type of normalising has been selected.</li></ul>
