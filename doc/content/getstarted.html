<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Before using Xena 4.0, a couple of simple initial settings must be made. These are found via the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</p>
<p>The location where files are to be stored <i>after</i> the conversion process must be specified. It is also useful to set a location for Xena's log file.
</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org must be installed if Xena is to normalise such files as word processed documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Xena uses a <b>2.2.x</b> version of OpenOffice.org, which may be downloaded freely from <i>http://download.openoffice.org</i>.
</p>
<p>If OpenOffice.org 2.2.x is not installed then Xena will binary normalise these file types.</p>
<p>See the <a href="setdirectories.html">Set Preferences</a> and <a href="setplugins.html">Set Up Plugins</a> sections below to configure these settings.</p><br>
