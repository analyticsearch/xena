<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Before using Xena 4.0, a couple of simple initial settings must be made. These are found via the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</p>
<p>The location where files are to be stored <i>after</i> the conversion process must be specified. It is also useful to set a location for Xena's log file.
</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org must be installed if Xena is to normalise files such as word processed documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Xena uses a <b>2.2.x</b> version of OpenOffice, which may be downloaded freely from <b><a href="http://download.openoffice.org">http://download.openoffice.org</a></b>.
</p>
<p>If OpenOffice.org 2.2.x is not installed then Xena will binary normalise these file types.</p>
