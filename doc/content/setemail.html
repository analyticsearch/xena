<p>The external tool for converting Outlook PST files is included in the Xena package and will be located in a subdirectory at the same location as the Xena program (xena.jar).</p>

<p>For Windows the file is called <b>readpst.exe</b> and will be located in the subdirectory called <b>winx86</b>, while under Linux the file is simply <b>readpst</b> and sits under a subdirectory called <b>lini386</b>. The version for OSX will depend on your architecture - if using a PPC computer then the subdirectory will be <b>macppc</b> and if using an Intel computer will be <b>macx86</b>.</p>

<p>Click <b>Browse</b> and navigate to the location of program relevant to your computer, then click <b>OK</b> to save this setting.</p>
