<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Xena 4.0 has been designed by the National Archives of Australia to aid in the long-term preservation of digital information. The Xena user interface is a convenient means of accessing the core functions of the National Archives' digital preservation framework.
</p>
<p>Xena can convert any data object into an ASCII representation containing XML metadata, via base64 encoding. This is known as 'binary normalisation' and is fully reversible when there is a need to re-create an original data object. Xena can also convert data objects into openly specified file formats, such as XML or PNG, in a process known as 'normalisation.' These normalised files may be accessed via the Xena viewer.
