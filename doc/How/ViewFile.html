<h2>How to View Xena Files</h2>
<p>Once a digital record has been normalised, when it is later opened the guessers will recognise it as a XenaFileType and Xena will select a viewer as the primary choice to display the record.</p>
<p>A XenaFileType may have multiple views; for example a preserved image file may be displayed within Xena as an image (Package view). It can also be viewed as raw XML (both normalised and XML wrapped), or in the form of an XML tree. More complex file types, such as multimedia files, will have more views available.</p>
