<h2>How to view a normalised image</h2>

<p>Xena uses the image plugin to view normalised Xena-PNG and Xena-JPEG files. The image plugin is part of the basic Xena application.</p>

<p>To view an image that has been normalised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <em>Xena</em>.
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Open</em>.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, select the normalised image you wish to view and click on <em>Open</em>. <br>Xena will display the image. 
  </ol>

 

<p>Multipage TIFF images are presented in the Xena multipage view. To move between the pages of the multipage Xena view, click on the various buttons. The <em>First</em> button will display the first page of the package. The <em>Last</em> button will display the final page of the package. The <em>Previous</em> and <em>Next</em> buttons will move between the previous and next pages. If you wish to go to a particular page, type the number in the <em>Page</em> box and press <em>Enter</em>.</p>

<h3>View menu options</h3>
<p>The View menu provides options for the current view of the current document. The options available under the View Menu will depend on the type of document that Xena is displaying, and the view of that document that you have chosen. The following sub-menu options are available for the Package view of images.</p>

<h3>Zoom</h3>
<p>This sub-menu allows you to enlarge or reduce the display size of the image to a certain percentage of the normalised image size. There are preset percentages, or you can enter a custom zoom percentage.</p>

<h3>Fit</h3>
<p>This sub-menu allows you to enlarge or reduce the display size of the image, based on the size of the active window. The options available are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fit to Size</em> reduces or enlarges the image so that it fits neatly within the display window.
<li><em>Fit to Width</em> reduces or enlarges the image so that it fills the width of the display window.
<li><em>Fit to Height</em> reduces or enlarges the image so that it fills the height of the display window.
<li><em>Fit to Both</em> stretches or compresses the image so that it fits neatly within the display window, which can change the aspect ratio of the image.
</ul>
