<h2>Set General Properties</h2>
<p>At minimum, a File Namer and a Package Wrapper must be selected before Xena can normalise files.</p>
<h3>To change the Xena properties</h3>
<ol>
<li>From the <em>Edit</em> menu select <em>Properties</em></li>
<li>The <em>Xena Properties</em> window is displayed</li>
<img src="xena_prop_gen.jpg"><br><br>
<li>ensure that at least a File Namer and a Package Wrapper are selected</li>
<li>click <em>OK</em> to save the settings</li>
</ol>

<p>You can now change the Xena properties to your desired settings. These properties are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#view">Prompt User for View down to Level</a>
<li><a href="#max">Maximize New View Windows</a>
<li><a href="#log">Save Log Automatically</a>
<li><a href="#look">Look and Feel</a>
<li><a href="#namer">File Namer</a>
<li><a href="#wrapper">Package Wrapper</a>
<li><a href="#colour">Background Colour</a>
</ul>


<h3><a name="view">Prompt User for View down to Level</a></h3>

<p>By setting this value to anything other than zero, Xena will always prompt the user to select the type of view to use to display Xena XML. If you do not wrap your XML, the most useful options are 0 or 1. If your XML is wrapped the values 0, 1 or 2 will be the most useful. If you set the value to something larger, you may find Xena prompting you to an annoying degree.</p>

<p>To understand this menu option you need to understand Xena views. A Xena XML document contains one or more major sub-portions corresponding to the available XML DTDs. In the case of the National Archives of Australia's DTDs, all Xena documents contain at least two major sub-portions: the package wrapper, and the actual data object. Some data objects are composite objects. For example, a multipage contains a number of sub-objects, usually images. Datasets contain sub-objects for each cell.</p>

<p>The <em>view down to level</em> value therefore corresponds to the depth within the tree of sub-objects and sub-views to continue prompting the user for the view type. By setting the view level to higher than 0, you can directly choose to view only a portion of the document. This may be useful if you are consistently working with multiple sub-views, but does mean that every time you open a Xena package for viewing, you will be prompted for the type of view. The preferred method for changing views is using the change view menu option to select your view preference after the file is already displayed with the default view.</p>

<p>In the view, each major portion is represented by a window. For sub-portions, they are represented as sub-windows within the outer window. In the package view you don't actually see this; rather the entire view is over laid with the view of its sub-object. And that sub-object, in the case of a multipage, has a sub-window/sub-view where you see the image.</p>

<p>If you choose the Raw XML or Tree view, the views don't recognise the boundaries between the distinct portions of the XML corresponding to the DTDs, and don't have sub-windows, but rather show the entire XML in one window. The package view shows its data using the default view-specific sub-view.</p>

<p>Raw XML and Tree views can be used to view only portions, rather than the entire object, but by default this feature is disabled in XML Plugin's preferences to avoid confusion. If it is enabled, you could view just one element of a dataset in the form view as its raw XML.</p>


<h3><a name="max">Maximize New View Windows</a></h3>

<p>When checked, Xena will open new View windows to the maximum available on your monitor.</p>


<h3><a name="log">Save Log Automatically</h3></a> 

<p>When checked, Xena will save the normalisation log for batch processing to the configuration directory you set when you <a href="SetBaseDirs.html">set the base directories</a>. The file will be saved as <em>log.txt</em> and contains all the information recorded by the batch processor.</p>


<h3><a name="look">Look and Feel</h3></a> 

<p>You can choose the overall look and feel of the Xena user interface. The available options for look and feel will depend on the platform you are running on, however all platforms should have the <em>Metal</em> look and feel, which is the native Java look. Other options may include a Windows and Mac look on these respective platforms. When you change the look and feel, certain differences may not be evident without restarting Xena.</p>

<p>You can choose a look and feel by selecting it from the drop down menu list.</p>

<h3><a name="namer">Setting the File Namer</h3></a>

<p>As part of normalisation files are named according to the rules laid out in the file namer. Archival institutions will probably wish to name their output files using their own custom algorithm. After installing Xena, users should configure the file namer to be the one corresponding to their organisation's policies. See the <em>NAA Plugin</em> for further information about the NAA File Namer.</p>

<p>You can choose a file namer by selecting it from the installed namers in the drop down menu list.</p>

<h3><a name="wrapper">Setting the package wrapper</h3></a>

<p>This allows you to select a module to wrap all normalised files with extra XML. This can be used, for example, to wrap a normalised file with metadata. The NAA has a format to wrap XML files with checksums, identifiers and other metadata. See the <em>NAA Plugin</em> for further information about the NAA package wrapper. Archival institutions will probably wish to wrap the standard XML output formats in their own custom metadata. After installing Xena, configure the package wrapper to be the one corresponding to your organisation's policies.</p> 

<p>You can choose a package wrapper by selecting it from the installed wrappers in the drop down menu list.</p>


<h3><a name="colour">Background Colour</h3></a>

<p>This option lets you set the background screen colour for Xena. To choose a background colour click on the <em>Browse</em> button. This opens the <em>Select Colour</em> window, which allows you to select your desired background screen colour. You can select by one of three methods - Colour Swatch, HSB or RGB. Once you have chosen your desired colour click <em>OK</em> to set it as your background colour.</p>
