<h2>Batch Filter By Word</h2>
<p>A common type of searching is by a single word in the title. This could be used to select files relating to the same topic or containing a particular keyword in the file title. As an example, to normalise all files in a directory containing the word "minister" in the title the <i>Regular Expression</i> would be <code>.*\bminister\b.*</code> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.*</code> means any number of any character, ie a wildcard for zero or more of any characters. We include it at both the beginning and the end so that we find the word "minister" anywhere in the title.</li>
<li><code>\b</code> marks a word boundary, ie the beginning or ending of a single word. Without it we would include words such as "ministerial" or "administer".  We include it at the beginning and the end to denote the start and finish of the word we want.</li>
<li>minister is the word we want to select for, so it is included between the other elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To select by word</h3>
<ol>
<li>From the Xena <i>File</i> menu, select <i>Batch Normalise.</i></li>
<li>In the <i>Regular Expression</i> box enter <code>.*\ b[word]\b.* </code></li>
<li>Click <i>Go</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All files in the Source pane whose name contains the word entered in the <i>Regular Expression</i> box will be copied to the Destination pane.</p>
</ol>
