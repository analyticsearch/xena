<h2>Batch Normaliser</h2>
<p>While Xena can be used to normalise individual records, it is more likely you will want to automatically normalise all the records in a directory, especially when there may be thousands. Xena does this using batch normalisation. The Xena batch normalisation process goes through an entire directory, including sub-directories, and normalises all the records within that directory that it is able to normalise, according to the instructions that you have given it.</p>

<p>There are several ways of using the batch normaliser. You can select a single directory, and all the files within it, or you can use <i><a href="SetRegExps.html">Regular Expressions</a></i> - a batch filter to select all files with a particular file extension or file title from one or more directories.</p>

<p>You can rely on the Xena guessers to determine which normaliser to use, or you can specify the type of files you are normalising, and choose the normaliser to use. These decisions are made when you set up each batch normalisation run.</p>

<p>You use the <em>Batch Processing Setup</em> window to do batch processing in Xena. To open this window, from the <em>File</em> menu select <em>Batch Process</em>. This is what the batch processing setup window looks like:</p>

<p>The batch processing window and the options it offers is explained in <a href="../Command/BatchElements.html"> Batch Window Elements</a>.</p> 


<p>As <i>Xena</i> normalises files, the results will appear in the bottom window. When the batch normalisation is complete, the <i>Stop</i> button will grey out and a completion notice will be appended to the results list in the bottom window.  The results window will show <i>OK</i> for each file that is properly normalised, <i>ER</i> if there is an error and <i>NN</i> for a warning message.</p>

<p>The process you use to normalise batches of records will depend on how you want to run the normalisation process.</p>
