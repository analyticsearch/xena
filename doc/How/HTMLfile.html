<h2>Normalise HTML File</h2>
<p>Xena normalises HTML documents using the HTML plugin. This plugin is part of the basic Xena application.</p>

<p>Many web browsers are very forgiving of faulty HTML. As a consequence, it is possible for pages which do not fully comply with the HTML standard to display properly within a web browser. This non-compliance can either be through poor quality coding, or actual corruption of the file. When normalising HTML, Xena attempts to correct faulty HTML into conforming XHTML.  If your HTML is too corrupt, you may have to make manual changes to correct errors such as unknown tags.</p>

<p>The HTML normaliser only normalises single, simple HTML pages. It does not normalise or include any associated images or other resources attached to a HTML page. </p> 


<h3>To normalise an HTML document</h3>

<ol>
<li>Open <em>xena</em>.
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Normalise File</em>.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, navigate to and select the HTML document that you wish to normalise.
<li>Click on <em>Open</em>.
   <br>The <em>Choose File Type</em> dialog box will open, asking you to choose the file type of the document you are opening. 
<li>Select <em>HTML</em> from the drop down list and click <em>OK</em>.
   <br>The HTML document will now be displayed by Xena.
</ol>

<p>The HTML document has now been normalised into the Xena XHTML format. </p>
