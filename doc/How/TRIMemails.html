<h2>Normalise a TRIM Email</h2>
<p>TRIM is an electronic document and records management system created by Tower Software. When emails are stored in the system they are converted into mbx format. Any attached files are also stored in the system. When the email is later exported from the system any attachments are exported with it. The Xena TRIM email normalisation process normalises the email together with any attachments that are part of it. </p>

<p>Xena normalises TRIM email messages using the email plugin. This plugin is part of the basic Xena application. When normalising TRIM emails you will need to point the TRIM normalisation processor at the folder containing the TRIM email. This way any attachments that are part of the email will also be captured into the email.</p>
 

<h3>To normalise a TRIM email</h3>


<ol>
<li>Open <em>Xena</em>.
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Normalise File</em>.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, navigate to and select the folder containing the TRIM email message that you wish to normalise.
<li>Click on <em>Open</em>.
   <br>The <em>Choose File Type</em> dialog box will open, asking you to choose a file type for the email that you are opening. 
<li>Select <em>TRIM email</em> from the drop down list and click <em>OK</em>.
   <br>The TRIM email message will now be displayed by Xena.
</ol>

<p>The TRIM email message has now been normalised into the Xena email format. </p>
