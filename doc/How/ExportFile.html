<h2>How to Export Xena Files</h2>
 
 
<ol>
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu select <em>Export</em>.
<li>Navigate to and select the file to be exported.
<li>Click on <em>Open</em>.
<li>The <em>Save</em> window will open.
<li>Navigate to and select the location where you want to save the file to be exported.
<li>Click on <em>Save</em> to save the file.
</ol>

<p>If you wish to change the name of the file then you can do so before you save it. Just be sure not to change the file extension otherwise you may render the file unreadable.</p>

<p>You should now be able to open up the file just as you would with any other file on your computer. You will of course need an application that can read it.</p>
