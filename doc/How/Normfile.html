<h2>Normalise Files</h2>
<p>When opening a file for normalising, Xena uses its guessers to guess the file type. It does this by sequentially checking if the file conforms to the known properties of a particular file type (file extensions, file layout, etc). It uses all of its guessers in sequence, then suggests the possible options with its best guess as the default option.</p>
<p>If the file is a Xena file, it should always be correctly identified. Other types of files will vary in the guessing accuracy. Once the file type is known, Xena will choose a normaliser that can normalise that file type. If the file type is already Xena, <i>Normalise Files</i> just opens it for viewing.</p>
