<h2>How to view a normalised collection of emails</h2>

<p>Xena uses the email plugin to view normalised email documents and collections of emails. This plugin is part of the basic Xena application.</p>

<p>When it normalises a collection of emails, such as a <code>.pst</code> file, Xena noramlises each email file as an individual item. So to view an normalised collection of emails you will need to look at the individual emails. See <a href="ViewEmail.html">How to view a normalised email message</a> for how to do this.<p>
