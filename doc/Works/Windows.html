<h2>Xena on Windows</h2>
<p>Xena is a Java application and can run on any Windows operating system that can support a Java Runtime Environment. Xena has been thoroughly tested on Windows 2000.</p>

<h3>Swapping between Xena and other applications when the batch processor window is open</h3>

<p>There is an issue when using the batch processor on Windows OS that users should be aware of. As batch processing can take a considerable amount of time, it is common practise to switch to another application while batch processing runs in the background. When a user clicks on the Windows taskbar to return to Xena, the standard Xena interface is presented, not the batch processing window, and Xena appears to be frozen. </p>
<p>This is not a bug, it is normal behaviour for Java based applications. Xena has not frozen and the batch processor window is still open.</p>
<p>To return to Xena, use the ALT+TAB keys to switch tasks and select Xena. Do this by holding down the ALT key and repeatedly pressing the TAB key until Batch Processing is selected in the pop-up window.</p>
