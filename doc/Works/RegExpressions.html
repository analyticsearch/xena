<h2>Batch Filters</h2>
<p><i>Regular Expression</i> is the term Xena uses to describe its "batch filters".  It is a language you can use to search the contents of a directory by file title or type using pattern matching.  The search will select and return any files whose title or type matches the <i>Regular Expression</i> you create. This can be useful when the directory containing the files you want to normalise is large and you can clearly define the types of files you want to process.</p>


<p><i>Regular Expressions</i> are constructed from a number of elements. These elements include the text you wish to match to and one or more constructs that denote a wildcard, whitespace or other element of the file name. See "<a href="ComRegExps.html">Common Batch Filters</a>" for a list of commonly used constructs.<p>
