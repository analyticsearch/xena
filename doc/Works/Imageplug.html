<h2>About the Image Plugin</h2>
<p>Xena can normalise many image file formats including PNG, JPEG, TIFF and GIF. Xena uses the image plugin to normalise images. This is part of the basic Xena application.</p>

<p>Xena can normalises image files into one of two formats, Xena-PNG and Xena-JPEG. PNG and JPEG are the two core formats that Xena uses internally and these two formats are treated separately by Xena. Other image formats are normalised by Xena into one of these two formats. Because PNG uses a Red/Green/Blue colour space and JPEG uses a Yellow/Cyan/Magenta colour space, it was decided to retain both these formats as core Xena types to avoid image loss.</p>
