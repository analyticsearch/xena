<h2>Xena and Base Directories</h2>
<p>Before normalising records you must specify the highest source directory of the files you want to normalise, and the destination directory to store the normalised Xena files. This is called <em><a href="../How/SetBaseDirs.html">setting the base directories</a></em>. You need to do it initially, and whenever the location of the source or destination directory changes. If Xena notices that your source directory is not a super-directory of the file you are normalising, Xena will force you to set the source directory.</p>

<p>While it is not necessary, except when <a href="../How/BatchNorm.html">normalising batches of records</a>, it is also wise to set two other directories, the <em>Error</em> and <em>Configuration</em> directories.</p>


<h3>The source directory</h3>

<p>Xena requires you to tell it the highest source directory from which you are normalising files, as well as the destination directory to save normalised files.</p>

<p>The source directory is not used directly by Xena, but it is assumed that an archival institution will probably want this information so that Xena can figure out the relative path of each file and preserve this information; either in package wrap metadata, or by mirroring the relative path in the destination directory. The NAA preserves this in XML metadata. If you are not interested in preserving this information, set the source directory to the root of your file system.</p>


<h3>The destination directory</h3>

<p>The destination directory is used by Xena for the default output directory of normalised files.</p>


<h3>The configuration directory</h3>

<p>Every time a normalisation takes place an XML file is created in the configuration directory that corresponds to the output Xena file. The configuration file records the parameters passed to the normalising process. This can be used to re-do a normalisation with the same parameters. It is used with the Xena batch processor, where it can speed up the normalisation of files by re-using the same configuration. For more information on how to do this see the file menu in the <a href="../Command/BatchMenu.html">Batch Menu Options</a>.

<h3>The error directory</h3>

<p>The error directory is only used for certain normalisers, such as the http (websites) normaliser. These normalisers work with a large number of files at a time, all from a single source - such as a website address - and it is inevitable that some of these files will fail to normalise. Where this happens, Xena will copy any file that fails to normalise into the error directory. The user can then examine that file and determine why Xena couldn't normalise it and possibly fix any problems. When you normalise that source again, Xena will take data from the error directory instead of the original source, thus merging user corrections with the original data.</p>
