<h2>About the Basic Plugin</h2>
<p>The basic plugin may be used to normalise any file in a process known as XML wrapping or binary normalisation. The basic plugin also provides converters for the datetime, string and integer data formats, which are usually used when normalising datasets.</p>

<p>All computer files are binary data, so any file type can be normalised as a binary file. What this normalisation does is convert the file into a Base64 encoding, essentially an ASCII text representation of the data, and then wrap it in XML containing metadata about the file. This is a reversible conversion, which means that it is possible to reproduce the original bitstream of the file from the XML wrapped version.</p> 

<p>XML wrapping serves two purposes in the preservation process. The first is that Xena may be unable to normalise a particular data format because the plugin for that format does not exist. The second is that you may wish to preserve the original bitstream of a file in addition to normalising it. The main purpose of this is to enable a file to be normalised again if there is any question over the normalised version's authenticity.</p>
