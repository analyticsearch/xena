<h2>About the XML Plugin</h2>
<p>The XML plugin enables you to view any Xena normalised files as either Raw XML or an XML Tree. The XML plugin does not provide any normalisation capacity, but provides a universal viewing or performance capability.</p>

<h3>Raw XML view</h3>
<p>This is available when you have changed the view in Xena to display the normalised package as Raw XML. It enables you to view the normalised Xena package as a single XML document. In addition to viewing the content you are also able to view the Xena package wrapper and any associated metadata. in all other respects it is just like the plain text view.</p>

<h3>View menu options</h3>
<p>The View menu provides you with options for the current view of the current document. The options available under the View Menu depend on the type of document that Xena is displaying and the view of the document you have chosen. The following sub-menu options are available when viewing a document as raw XML.</p>

<h3>Wrap</h3>
<p>This submenu allows you to choose how Xena wraps the displayed text. You may choose between having no text wrapping, wrapping at the character level, or wrapping at word level.</p>

<h3>Set Tab Size</h3>
<p>This sub-menu allows you to set the number of character spaces between each tab stop when displaying plain text documents.</p>

<h3>Font</h3>
<p>This sub-menu allows you to switch between monospace and unicode style fonts.</p>


<h3>XML tree view</h3>
<p>This is available when you have changed the view in Xena to display the normalised package as an XML tree. If you wish to examine the XML structure of a normalised record this view is perhaps more useful than the raw XML view as you can see the layered structure of the document and the different XML elements are more clearly visible.</p>

<h3>View menu options</h3>
<p>The View menu provides you with options for the current view of the current document. The options available under the View menu depend on the type of document that Xena is displaying and the view of the document you have chosen. The view menu has no options when viewing normalised documents as an XML tree.</p>


<h3>Preferences for XML</h3>

<p>The XML plugin preferences allows you to choose whether to <em>Allow Raw XML View for Sub-views </em> and or <em>Allow Tree XML view for Sub-views</em>. By ticking these options you be able to select to view records as XML by selecting a lower level of the display tree when changing view. For how to change the way you view a record, see <em><a href="../Command/Windowmenu.html#change_view">Change View</a></em> under <em>Menubar Options</em> - <em>Window Menu</em> for details.</p>
