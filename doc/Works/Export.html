<h2>Exporting Xena Files</h2>
<body>
<p>The <em>Export</em> menu option allows you to export a Xena file in its native format. For instance, an HTML document that has been normalised would be exported as an HTML document, or a normalised image would be exported as a PNG image.</p>

<p>Xena's ability to export does vary with different data formats. It cannot export emails or datasets. Its ability to export other data formats are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Office documents</em> such as word, powerpoint and excel files are exported as OpenOffice flat XML. </li>
<p><li><em>HTML</em> documents are exported as html.
<p><li><em>Plain text</em> documents are exported as plain text, Xena will include the file extension.</li> 
<p><li><em>Image files</em> such as bitmaps, JPEGs and GIFs are exported as PNG images.</li> 
<p><li><em>binary normalised</em> files are exported, however you will need to add the correct extension to the file name to be able to read it. ie, if it was a pdf file, adding <code>.pdf</code> to the end of the file will enable you to open and read it.</li>
</ul>
