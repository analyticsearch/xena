<h2>Viewing Xena Files</h2>
<p>An important aspect of keeping archival records is that you need to be able to access the data you have archived; otherwise there is no point keeping the data. Xena is able to view (perform) any record that it can normalise. We use the term perform rather than view because not all digital records can be viewed. A sound file, for instance, is heard rather than viewed.</p>
<p>Performance consists of taking the normalised record (the data object) and combining it with the information necessary for the recipient to interpret that data object. This combination is the performance of the record. For more information on performing records see the National Archives Green Paper: <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/recordkeeping/er/digital_preservation/summary.html">An Approach to the Preservation of Digital Records</a>.</p>
