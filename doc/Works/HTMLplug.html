<h2>About the HTML Plugin</h2>
<p>Xena can normalise documents that meet the W3C definition for HTML using the HTML plugin. This is included as part of the basic Xena application and does not require any third party software.</p>
 

<p>The HTML normaliser only normalises single, simple HTML pages. It does not normalise or include any associated images or other resources attached to a HTML page. However when you normalise a HTTP web site you can select to normalise the resources associated with it, such as images.</p>
