<h2>Xena on Mac OSX</h2>
<body>
<p>Xena is a Java application which runs on the Mac OSX operating system. Xena has been tested on Mac OSX, and all the major functions are operating. However, this testing has revealed a few issues with running Xena on Mac OSX.</p> 

<h3>Automatic file naming</h3>

<p>The Save As dialog box does not correctly show the default output file name. This appears to be a bug in the Java Mac OSX look and feel.</p>

<p>If you encounter this problem, change the look and feel to Metal.

<h3>Set the look and feel to Metal</h3>

<ol>
<li>From the <em>Edit</em> menu select the <em>Preferences</em> submenu.
<li>From the <em>Preferences</em> submenu select <em>Look and Feel</em>.
<li>From the <em>Look and Feel</em> submenu select <em>Metal</em>.
</ol>

<h3>Known issues with MacOSX</h3>

<p>Xena requires Java 1.4.2 to run on Mac OSX, which in turn runs on Mac OS10.3.4 or later. </p>
<p>OpenOffice.org on Mac OSX is only available for version 1.0, whereas Xena was designed to work with OpenOffice 1.1. It is not anticipated that Xena will support OpenOffice 1.0.</p>
