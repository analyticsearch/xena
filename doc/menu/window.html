<h1>The Window menu</h1>

<p>The window menu enables you to change between open windows and to open new windows. You can also change the type of view for an open normalised file.</p>

<h2><a name="change_view">Change View</a></h2>

<p>This menu option enables you to change how Xena presents a record. When you first view a record, Xena uses the default view type for that record type. If your organisation wraps records with package metadata, the package will be the outermost view, containing a sub-view showing the record itself.</p>

<p>The default view presents the record in a manner that preserves as much as possible the original look and feel of the record. You can also view the record in other ways. Usually there will be a raw XML view of the record, in addition to the record type specific view or views. Because views can be embedded within views, Xena displays a dialog box asking which part of the view to change.</p>

<h3>Changing Views</h3>

<p> To change the view of a normalised record, open the record and then do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <em>Window</em> menu select <em>Change View</em>.<br>
   The <em>Change View</em> window will open.<br>
   <img src="change_view.jpg">
<li>Select the top item on the tree; for example <em>Package View</em>.
<li>Select the desired view from the drop down list at the bottom of the <em>Change View</em> window and click <em>OK</em>.<br>
   The file will display in the desired view.
</ol>

<h2>Clone</h2>

<p>This menu option copies the active document window, opening a second version of the same document using the default view for that record type. This is useful if you wish to have two or more different views of the same file open at the same time.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Clone will not clone the chosen view of the record</p>

<h2>Close</h2>
<p>This closes the active window.</p>

<h2>Tile</h2>
<p>This tiles all the active windows, displaying all of them at the same time.</p>

<h2><img src="ViewLog.gif">View Normaliser Log</h2>
<p>This menu option allows you to view the normalisation log file for a recently normalised file. If you close a file after normalising it you will not be able to view the normalisation log file, unless you save it. To save an open log file, from the <em>File</em> menu select <em>Save Log</em>.</p> 


<h2>List of open documents</h2>
<p>At the bottom of the Window menu, Xena lists all of the open documents. The active document has a bullet point next to it on the menu. Select the chosen window to activate it.</p>
