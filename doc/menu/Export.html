<h1>How to Export Xena Files</h1>

<p>The <em>Export</em> menu option allows you to export a Xena file in its native format. For instance, an HTML document that has been normalised would be exported as an HTML document, or a normalised image would be exported as a PNG image.</p>

<p>xena's ability to export does vary with different data formats. It cannot export emails or datasets. Its ability to export other data formats are as follows:</p>

<p><em>Office documents</em> such as word, powerpoint and excel files are exported as OpenOffice flat XML. </p>
<p><em>HTML</em> documents are exported as html, however you will need to add an html extension to the file name.</p>
<p><em>Plain text</em> documents are exported as plain text,Xena will include the file extension.</p>
<p><em>Image files</em> such as bitmaps, JPEGs and GIFs are exported as PNG images.</p>
<p><em>binary normalised</em> files are exported, however you will need to add the correct extension to the file name to beable to read it. ie, if it was a pdf file, adding <code>.pdf</code> to the end of the file will enable you to open and read it.</p>



<h3>How to export Xena normalised files</h3>

<p>Use the following procedure to export files from Xena</p>

<ol>
<li>from the <em>file</em> menu select <em>export</em>
<li>navigate to and select the file to be exported
<li>click on <em>open</em>
<li>the <em>Save</em> window will open
<li>navigate to and select the location where you want to save the file to be exported
<li>click on <em>save</em> to save the file
</ol>

<p>If you wish to change the file's name then you can do so before you save it. Just be sure not t change the file extension otherwise you may render the file unreadable.</p>

<p>You should now be able to open up the file just as you would with any other file on your computer. You will of course need an application that can read it.</p>
