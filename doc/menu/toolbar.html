<h1>The Xena toolbar</h1>

<p>The Xena toolbar provides quick access to the most commonly used functions of Xena.</p>

<h2><img src="Import.gif">Normalise</h2>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to normalise any file type supported by Xena. See <a href="file.html#normalise">Normalise File</a> for more information on this option.</p>


<h2><img src="Export.gif">Export</h2>
<p>This toolbar button allows you to export a Xena file in its native format. For instance, an Office document that has been normalised would be exported as an OpenOffice.org document, or a normalised image would be exported as a PNG image. See <a href="Export.html">How to Export Xena Files</a> for how to use this toolbar button.</p>


<h2><img src="NormNonFile.gif">Normalise Non-File</h2>
<p>Xena usually normalises data objects by accessing them as data files through a filesystem. This toolbar button allows you to access data objects through other protocols such as JDBC (for relational database systems) and HTTP (for web resources).</p>


<h2><img src="Batch.gif">Batch Process</h2>
<p>This toolbar button is used to open the batch normalisation process. The batch normalisation process is the most common way to normalise records, as it handles entire directories. For details on how to normalise a batch of records, see <a href="../batch/index.html">Normalising Batches of Records</a>.</p>


<h2><img src="Open.gif">Open</h2>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to open a Xena file for viewing. See <a href="file.html#open">Open</a> for more information on this option</p>


<h2><img src="SaveAs.gif">Save As</h2>
<p>This toolbar button is used to save a document once it has been opened in Xena. It is used as part of the normalisation process to save non-normalised documents that have been opened in Xena. It will always save a document as a Xena XML package, ie a normalised record. For details on how to normalise a record, see the appropriate section for the type of record you want to view or normalise.</p>


<h2><img src="SetBaseDir.gif">Set Base Directories</h2>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to set the base directories in Xena. For more information on the base directories and how to set them see <a href="../configure/set_base_dir.html">Xena and Base Directories</a>.</p>


<h2><img src="Clone.gif">Clone</h2>
<p>This toolbar button copies the active document window, opening a second version of the same document using the default view for that record type. <em>Note:</em> Clone will not clone the chosen view of the record</p>


<h2><img src="Tile.gif">Tile</h2>
<p>This tiles all the active windows, displaying all of them at the same time.</p>

<h2><img src="ViewLog.gif">View Log</h2>
<p>This toolbar button allows you to view the normalisation log file for a recently normalised file. If you close a file after normalising it you will not be able to view the normalisation log file, unless you save it. To save an open log file, from the <em>File</em> menu select <em>Save Log</em>.</p> 

<h2><img src="ChangeView.gif">Change View</h2>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to change how Xena presents a record. See <a href="window.html#change_view">Change View</a> for more information on this option.</p>

<h2><img src="Help.gif">Help Topics</h2>
<p>This toolbar button displays the user documentation, which includes information on how to use Xena as well as Xena-supported format specifications.</p>

<!-- <h2><img src="ContextualHelp.gif">Contextual Help</h2>
<p>Press this button, then click on selected graphical elements in Xena to get contextual help.</p> 
contextual help is not supported in Xena 1.0 -->
