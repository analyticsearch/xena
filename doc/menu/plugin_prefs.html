<h1>Plugin preferences</h1>

<p>The plugin preferences, a sub-menu of the Edit menu, enables you to set the preferences for the Xena plugins. A menu item will appear here for each plugin you have installed that allows you to set preferences. Thus the options you have here will depend on the plugins you have installed.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the office plugin this will allow you to configure it to normalise records. For details, see the Office plugin Help. The XML plugin preferences allows you to set options related to viewing documents in XML format. See the XML plugin Help for details.
