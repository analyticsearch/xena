<h1>The Edit menu</h1>

<p>The Edit menu enables you to configure Xena; both to set your personal preferences, and to select important configuration settings such as the base directories and integrating programs.</p>


<h2>Plugin Properties</h2>

<p>Xena is designed to be expanded over time to enable it to normalise and present an ever increasing variety of file formats. It does this using plugins, which are extra modules that provide the necessary functionality. This menu option enables you to set the preferences for each plugin. A menu item will appear here for each plugin you have installed that allows you to set properties. Thus the options you have here will depend on the plugins you have installed.</p>

<p>To learn more about the properties of a plugin and how to set them, see the <em>About ...</em>file for that plugin.</p>

<p>This menu option enables you to set the base directories in Xena. For more information on the base directories and how to set them see <a href="../configure/set_base_dir.html">Xena and Base Directories</a>.</p>


<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>This menu option enables you to set your personal preferences for the Xena interface and to disable some of the plugins if you so wish. For information on setting the Xena properties see <a href="../configure/set_xena_prop.html">Setting the Xena properties</a>.</p>
