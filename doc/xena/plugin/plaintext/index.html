<h1>About the Plain Text plugin</h1>

<p>Xena can normalise plain text documents, which are unformatted text files often coded in ASCII, or .txt files created by Microsoft Notepad. When normalising plain text documents, Xena uses the plaintext plugin. This is included as part of the basic Xena application and does not require any third party software.</p>

<p>For how to use the plain text plugin to normalise a plain text document, see <a href="norm_plaintext.html">How to normalise plain text documents</a>.</p>
