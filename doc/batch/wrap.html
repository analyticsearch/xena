<h1>Batch Binary Normalisation</h1>

<p>This is used to normalise binary files within a directory. This is also referred to as XML wrapping. For more information on XML wrapping see <em>How to XML wrap a data object</em>&nbsp in <em>Basic Plugin</em>.</p>

<p>This process converts each data file in a directory into base64 and places an XML wrapper containing metadata around it. The procedure assumes that you have read the <a href="index.html">Batch Normalisation Introduction</a>, and are familiar with the layout of the <em>Batch Processing Setup</em> window.</p> 

<p>This procedure assumes that you already have the <em>Batch Processing Setup</em> window open. If not, open it now:</p>
<ol>
<li>open <em>Xena</em>.
<li>from the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Batch Process</em>.
</ol>

<p>Before you batch normalise records, you should specify the location of the files you want to normalise and where you want to store the normalised versions. See the <a href="index.html">Batch Normalisation Introduction</a>. If you have not selected both source and destination directories, do so now.</p>

<h3>Selecting the directory</h3>
<p>You should first select the directory or directories you wish to XML wrap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the directory you wish to normalise in the left window and click on the <em>&#187;</em>&nbsp to move the directory into the right window under the groups folder.
<br>Repeat this step for each directory that you wish to normalise. </li>
<li>Use the <em>&#171</em>&nbsp or <em>clear</em> buttons to remove a directory from the list of those to be normalised.
<br>The directories you wish to XML wrap will now appear as groups in the output directory list.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Configuring the normaliser</h3>
<p>When XML wrapping the files in a directory, you will need to tell Xena it is XML wrapping all the files in the directory rather than relying on the Xena guesser to choose what to do. To do this, use the <em>Configure Batch Group</em> window:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the output directory select a group. You may only select one at a time.
<li>Click on the <em>Configure</em> button.
  <br>The <em>Configure Batch Group</em> window will open.
  <br><img src="batch_config.jpg">
<li>Under <em>File Type Selection</em>, click on <em>Select</em>.
<li>Select the <em>Binary</em> file type from the drop down list. 
<li>Xena will automatically select the Binary Normaliser.
<li>Click <em>OK</em>.
</ol>

<p>Repeat for each group selected.</p>

<h3>Running the batch XML wrapping process</h3>
<p>Now that the batch process has been configured, you can run the batch process itself. To do this click on the <em>Start</em> button.</p>

<p>To halt the batch process, click on the <em>Stop</em> button. To continue with a halted batch process, click on the <em>Continue</em> button. When you have finished the batch process, click on <em>Close</em>.</p>

<p>As Xena normalises files, the results will appear in the bottom window. When the batch normalisation is complete, the <em>Stop</em> button will grey out and a completion notice - the word <em>DONE</em> - will be appended to the results list in the bottom window. The results window will show <em>OK</em> for each file properly normalised, and <em>ER</em> if there is an error. Any error messages will be appended to the line for that document. </p>
