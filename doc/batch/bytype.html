<h1>Batch Normalising by File Type</h1>

<p>You may wish to normalise files of one particular type, JPEG images for instance, within a directory that contains multiple file types. You can specify the normaliser to be used - the JPEG normaliser in this case, rather than relying on Xena's guessers. While you could sort files by file type to normalise them, you can just select the relevant ones within a directory by using regular expressions.</p>

<p>You can use regular expressions to find files by file type by using the expression to search for files based on their file extension. This is a specialised version of <a href="byname.html">Batch Normalising by File Name</a>.</p>
