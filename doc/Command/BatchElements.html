<h2>Batch Window Elements</h2>
 The batch processing window is made up of several distinct elements. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#panes">Source, Destination and Normalisation Log panes</a>;
<li><a href="#setup">Normalisation Setup Buttons</a>;
<li><a href="#source">Source Directory box</a>;
<li><a href="#destn">Destination Directory Setup Controls</a>;
<li><a href="#regexp">Regular Expression box</a>;
<li><a href="#control">Normalisation Control buttons</a>; and
<li><a href="#bar">Progress and Status bars</a>;
</ul>

<h3><a name="panes">The Source, Destination and Normalisation Log panes</a></h3>

<p>The Source pane shows the directory tree of files and folders that are to be normalised - the source directory. Items are selected from this directory for normalisation. If you wish to change the source directory you can do so using the Source Directory box. You can also set it when setting the <a href="../How/SetBaseDirs.html">Xena base directories.</a></p>

<p>The Destination pane shows the groups of records to be normalised. When you select records from the source pane they are copied to the Destination pane in groups. By creating several different groups you can choose a different normaliser for each group. If you select a group in the Destination pane before you copy items from the Source pane then those items will be copied into the selected group, otherwise Xena will create a new group for them.</p>

<p>The Normalisation Log pane displays the results of the current batch normalisation job. This log shows each file that Xena attempted to normalise and whether that attempt was successful or not. If the attempt was not successful then it will show an error message. The Normalisation Log also includes the start and finish times of the normalisation run, how long it took, how many files were successfully normalised and how many errors were encountered.</p>


<h3><a name="setup">The Normalisation Setup Buttons</a></h3>

<p>The Normalisation Setup buttons are used to select files for normalisation from the Source pane and put them into the Destination pane.</p>

<p>The <em>&gt;&gt;</em> button copies the selected items in the Source pane to the Destination pane. If a group has already been selected in the Destination pane then it will copy the items into that group, otherwise it will create a new group.</p>

<p>The <em>&lt;&lt;</em> button removes the selected files in the Destination pane and selects them in the Source pane. This can be very slow for large numbers of files. The Clear button in the Destination Directory Setup controls is a better choice when dealing with a large number of files as it simply removes them from the Destination pane.</p>

<p>The <em>Guess</em> button searches for all the files of a particular type using the Xena guesser and copies them to the selected group in the Destination pane, or creates a new group if none are selected. When you click this button Xena will offer you a list of file types. You select one of them and Xena will then go through the files listed in the Source pane and select those matching that file type. You can then select that group and choose the appropriate normaliser for that file type.</p>

<p>The <em>Guess All</em> button searches through all the files in the Source pane using the Xena guesser and copies them to the Destination pane. It will create new groups based on the different file types, one new group for each file type. You can then select each group in turn and choose the appropriate normaliser for that file type.</p>

<p>The <em>To Do</em> button copies all the files in the Source pane that have not yet been normalised into the selected group in the Destination pane, or creates a new group if none are selected. It determines which files have not been normalised by running the file namer  on every file in the Source Directory to see if the corresponding file exists in the Destination Directory or not.</p>


<h3><a name="source">The Source Directory box</a></h3>

<p>The <em>Source Directory</em> box is used to select the Source Directory which is displayed in the Source pane. If this is not the directory to be normalised then use the <em>Browse</em> button to select the directory to normalise using the following procedure.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on the <em>Browse</em> button.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, navigate to and select the source directory.
<li>Click on the <em>Open</em> button.
</ol>

<p>The correct source directory is now displayed. You can also set it when setting the <a href="../How/SetBaseDirs.html">Xena base directories.</a></p>


<h3><a name="destn">The Destination Directory Setup Controls</a></h3>

<p>The <em>Destination Directory Setup Controls</em> are used to select the Destination Directory which is displayed in the Destination pane. They are also used to configure the normalisers.</p> 

<p>If the Destination directory listed is not the desired destination directory then use the <em>Browse</em> button to select the desired destination directory using the following procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on the <em>Browse</em> button.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, navigate to and select the destination directory.
<li>Click on the <em>Open</em> button.
</ol>

<p>The correct destination directory is now displayed. You can also set it when setting the <a href="../How/SetBaseDirs.html">Xena base directories.</a></p>

<p>The <em>Configure</em> button allows you to set parameters when normalising batches of records. This configuration is done at the level of groups of records, as selected in the output pane of the batch normalisation window. It is normally used as part of Batch normalising by file name. To configure the batch normalisation process for a group of records, select a group and click on the <em>Configure</em> button to open the Batch Configuration window.</p>


<h3><a name="regexp">The Regular Expression box</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Regular Expression</em> box is used to enter regular expressions as part of normalising by file name. For more information, see <i><a href="../How/SetRegExps.html">Batch Filters</i></a></p>


<h3><a name="control">The Normalisation Control buttons</a></h3> 
<p>The <em>Normalisation Control buttons</em> are used to run the batch normalising processes. Once you have set up a batch normalisation process you press the <em>Start</em> button to commence it. You press the <em>Stop</em> button to halt the process. The <em>Continue</em> button will restart a halted process, it will only normalise files that have not already been normalised. Next to the <em>Stop</em> button is an icon that swirls while a batch process is running. The <em>Close</em> button is used to close the <em>Batch Processing Setup</em> window once you have finished batch processing.</p>


<h3><a name="bar">The Progress and Status bars</a></h3>

<p>The <em>Progress</em> and <em>Status</em> bars show how a normalisation run is going. The <em>Progress</em> bar shows the progress of the normalisation of each file. The <em>Status</em> bar gives information on the normalisation. It shows whether the normalisation has worked, the time left to conduct the batch run and the name of the file currently being normalised.</p>
