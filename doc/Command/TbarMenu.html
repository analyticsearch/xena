<h2>Toolbar Menu</h2>
<p>The Xena toolbar provides quick access to the most commonly used functions of Xena.</p>

<h3><img src="Import.gif">Normalise</h3>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to normalise any file type supported by Xena.  


<h3><img src="Export.gif">Export</h3>
<p>This toolbar button allows you to export a Xena file in its native format. For instance, an Office document that has been normalised would be exported as an OpenOffice.org document, or a normalised image would be exported as a PNG image. S 


<h3><img src="NormNonFile.gif">Normalise Non-File</h3>
<p>Xena usually normalises data objects by accessing them as data files through a file system. This toolbar button allows you to access data objects through other protocols such as JDBC (for relational database systems) and HTTP (for web resources).</p>


<h3><img src="Batch.gif">Batch Process</h3>
<p>This toolbar button is used to open the batch normalisation process. The batch normalisation process is the most common way to normalise records, as it handles entire directories.  </p>


<h3><img src="Open.gif">Open</h3>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to open a Xena file for viewing. </p> 


<h3><img src="SaveAs.gif">Save As</h3>
<p>This toolbar button is used to save a document once it has been opened in Xena. It is used as part of the normalisation process to save non-normalised documents that have been opened in Xena. It will always save a document as a Xena XML package, ie a normalised record. </p>


<h3><img src="SetBaseDir.gif">Set Base Directories</h3>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to set the base directories in Xena.  </p>

<h3><img src="Clone.gif">Clone</h3>
<p>This toolbar button copies the active document window, opening a second version of the same document using the default view for that record type. <em>Note:</em> Clone will not clone the chosen view of the record.</p>


<h3><img src="Tile.gif">Tile</h3>
<p>This tiles all the active windows, displaying all of them at the same time.</p>

<h3><img src="ViewLog.gif">View Log</h3>
<p>This toolbar button allows you to view the normalisation log file for a recently normalised file. If you close a file after normalising it you will not be able to view the normalisation log file, unless you save it. To save an open log file, from the <em>File</em> menu select <em>Save Log</em>.</p> 

<h3><img src="ChangeView.gif">Change View</h3>
<p>This toolbar button enables you to change how Xena presents a record.  </p>

<h3><img src="Help.gif">Help Topics</h3>
<p>This toolbar button displays the user documentation, which includes information on how to use Xena as well as Xena-supported format specifications.</p>
