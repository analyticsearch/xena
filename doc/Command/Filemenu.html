<h2>File Menu</h2>
<h3><img src="Import.gif"><a name="normalise">Normalise File</a></h3>
<p>This enables you to normalise any file type supported by Xena.</p>

<p>When you open a file for normalising, Xena uses its guessers to guess its file type. It does this by sequentially checking if the file conforms to the known properties of a particular file type (file extensions, file layout, etc). It uses all of its guessers in sequence, then suggests the possible options, with its best guess as the default option. If the file is a Xena file, the guess should always be correctly identified. Other types of files will vary in the guessing accuracy. Once the file type is known, Xena will choose a normaliser that can normalise that file type. If the file type is already Xena, <em>Normalise Files</em> just opens it for viewing.</p>

<h3><img src="Export.gif">Export</h3>
<p>This option allows you to export a Xena file in its native format. For instance, an Office document that has been normalised would be exported as an OpenOffice.org document, or a normalised image would be exported as a PNG image.</p>
 
<h3><img src="NormNonFile.gif">Normalise Non-File</h3>
<p>Xena usually normalises data objects by accessing them as data files through a file system. This option allows you to access data objects through other protocols such as HTTP (for web resources).</p>

<h3><img src="Batch.gif">Batch Process</h3>
<p>This menu option is used to open the batch normalisation process. The batch normalisation process is the most common way to normalise records, as it handles entire directories.</p>
 

<h3><img src="Open.gif"><a name="open">Open</h3></a>
<p>This enables you to open a Xena file for viewing.</p>

<h3><img src="SaveAs.gif">Save As</h3>
<p>This menu option is used to save a copy of a normalised file. While the normalisation process automatically saves the normalised file into the default location with a name determined by the file namer, you may wish to save it in a different location and give it a different name. It will always save a file as a Xena XML package, ie a normalised record.</p>
 

<h3>Exit</h3>
<p>This menu option closes Xena.</p>
