<h2>Batch Menu Options</h2>
<p>The Batch processing setup window has two drop down menus, <i><a href="#file">File</a></i> and <i><a href="#tools">Tools</a></i></p> 
 
<h3><i><a name="file">File</i> Menu</h3>
<p><b><a name="savelog">Save Log</b><br>
Save Log is used to save the output log of a batch normalisation session as a text file. This lets you examine the log in detail in the text editor of your choice. When you select this menu option it will open a standard <em>Save</em> window. You should save the file in your desired directory. You will need to give it a file extension such as <code>.txt</code> or <code>.log</code>.</p>

<p><b><a name="#saveconfig">Save Config</b><br>
Save Config saves the current batch process configuration - ie the groups and their normaliser configuration - so that you may use them later. It does not save the list of files to be normalised. This is useful if you will be performing essentially the same or a similar batch process run several times. When you select this menu option it will open a standard <em>Save</em> window. You should save the file in your desired directory. You will need to give it a file extension such as <code>.txt</code> or <code>.cfg</code></p>

<p><b><a name="#loadconfig">Load Config</b><br>
Load Config loads a previously saved batch process configuration. When you select this menu option it will open a standard <em>Open</em> window. You should navigate to the directory containing the saved config file and select the file. Xena will create a new group which has the normalisation configuration defined in the saved config file.</p>


<h3><a name="tools">The Tools menu</h3>

<p><b><a name="#copyreg">Copy Regexp</b><br>
Copy Regexp is used with regular expressions to select files by name for normalisation. It copies all the files whose name matches the regular expression in the Regular Expression box to the currently selected group in the Destination pane. If there is no currently selected group in the Destination pane then it creates a new group. You can then normalise those files.</p>
<p>To use the Copy Regexp menu option you first enter a regular expression in the Regular Expressions box. Then from the <em>Tools</em> menu select <em>Copy Regexp</em>. For more information on how to use regular expressions, see <a href="../How/SetRegExps.html">Batch Filters</a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="#markreg">Mark Regexp</b><br>
Mark Regexp is used with regular expressions to select files by name for normalisation. It highlights all the files whose name matches the regular expression in the Regular Expression box. Unlike Copy Regexp it does not copy them to the Destination pane. This can be useful is you want to select only certain of the files for normalisation.</p>
<p>To use the Copy Regexp menu option you first enter a regular expression in the Regular Expressions box. Then from the <em>Tools</em> menu select <em>Copy Regexp</em>. For more information on how to use regular expressions, see <a href="../How/SetRegExps.html">Batch Filters</a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="#copytodo">Copy To Do</b><br>
Copy To Do copies all the files in the source directory which have not yet been normalised to the currently selected group in the destination directory. It determines which files have not been normalised by running the file namer on every file in the Source Directory to see if the corresponding file exists in the Destination Directory or not.</p>
<p>To use this menu option, select a source directory and a group in the destination pane. If you don't select a group in the destination pane then Xena will create a new group. Then from the <em>Tools</em> menu select <em>Copy To Do</em>. Xena will copy all of the files that have not been normalised into the selected group in the destination pane.</p>

<p><b><a name="#marktodo">Mark To Do</b><br>
Mark To Do highlights all the files which have not yet been normalised. Unlike Copy To Do it does not copy them to the Destination pane. This can be useful is you want to select only certain of the files for normalisation. It determines which files have not been normalised by running the file namer on every file in the Source Directory to see if the corresponding file exists in the Destination Directory or not.</p>
<p>To use this menu option, select a source directory and a group in the destination pane. If you don't select a group in the destination pane then Xena will create a new group. Then from the <em>Tools</em> menu select <em>Copy To Do</em>. Xena will mark all of the files that have not been normalised in the source pane.</p>
