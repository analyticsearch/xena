<h1>How to normalise Office documents</h1>

<p>When normalising Office documents such as those created by Microsoft Word, Xena uses the Office plugin. This is included as part of the basic Xena application. You will also need to install and configure OpenOffice.org. See <a href="index.html">About the Office plugin</a> for configuring the Office plugin for use with OpenOffice.org.</p>

<h3>Before normalising</h3>

<p>Before you can normalise a document, you will need to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed OpenOffice.org
<li><em>Set Base Directories</em>
</ul>

<p>For how to set the base directories. See <em>Setting the Base Directories</em> under <em>Configuring Xena</em>.</p>


<p>Xena currently supports normalisation of the following office document types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel</li>
<li>Microsoft Powerpoint</li>
<li>StarOffice and OpenOffice.org Writer (word processor)</li>
<li>StarOffice and OpenOffice.org Calc (spreadsheet)</li>
<li>StarOffice and OpenOffice.org Impress (presentation)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is anticipated that other common formats will be added to this list in the future.</p>
