<h1>How to view a normalised office document</h1>

<p>Xena uses the Office plugin to view normalised Xena-Office documents. This is part of the basic Xena application. You will also need to install and configure OpenOffice.org. See <a href="index.html">Introduction</a> for information on configuring the Office plugin for use with OpenOffice.org. Xena cannot display office documents internally; it uses OpenOffice.org to display the documents. The <em>Show in External Window</em> button opens the document in OpenOffice.org.</p>

<p>To view a document that has been normalised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <em>Xena</em>.
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Open</em>.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, navigate to and select the normalised document that you wish to view and click on <em>Open</em>.
  <br>Xena will dsiplay the normalised office document

<li>At the top of the display window is a <em>Show in OpenOffice.org</em> button. Clicking on this button will open the document in OpenOffice.org
</ol>

<p>While the inbuilt viewer for normalised Office documents in Xena shows the textual content of document being displayed, it can lose some formatting information. Viewing the document in OpenOffice.org, it will display this information and so is a preferable view.</p>

<p>The document displayed in OpenOffice.org is a read-only document, and is completely independent of Xena. You can save it using OpenOffice.org, and make changes to this version. This will not affect the normalised version of the document. When you have finished viewing the document, close it both in OpenOffice.org and Xena. </p>

<p>You can also view the document as Raw XML or as an XML Tree. See <em>Change View</em> under <em>Xena Menus</em> - <em>The Window Menu</em> for details on how to do this.</p>

<h2>View menu options</h2>

<p>The View menu provides you with options for the current view of the current document. There are no selectable options in Xena for viewing Office documents.</p>
