OpenOffice and LibreOffice conversion to many formats issues.

Major issue surrounding converting documents to HTML
- The URL the output file is converted with (xstorable.storeToURL(url, propertyvalue)
  - Currently is a String, with 3 slashes (file:///)
    - If the converted file is not written to the /tmp directory, but a sub directory, 
      then the conversion of HTML file fails to work, as any image tags are created trying 
      to reference the images in the parent directory.
    - All other conversion seem to work fine
    - Runs the same on both Linux and Windows
  - Changing the String to 2 slashes (file://)
    - Allows this to work correctly for any directory under Linux
    - Fails to find the file under Windows
  - Changing to a String representation of a URI ( .toURI().toString() )
    - Works for both Linux and Windows
- The input file has been placed into a temporary sub-directory of the temp directory
  - Under Linux this works for any directory
    - originally was placed in the same directory as the conversion output.
      - On Linux the file is deleted prior to the conversion output being written
      - On Windows the file is not deleted until nearer the completion of normalisation run,
	and only once processing has left the Office Plug-in completely.
  - Placing the input file its own sub-directory within the temp directory
    - Works on Linux
    - Produces an issue similar to the original under Windows where the images are referencing 
      the parent or an absolute directory

Therefore the input file will be placed in the same directory as the conversion output, 
and the copy function will be changed to only take the files of the appropriate name from 
that directory, thus under Windows leaving the input file behind, and under Linux taking all 
the files present.  This is messy, but is necessary until Windows handles the process correctly.

The files are correctly cleaned up under both Windows and Linux once the processing is complete.
