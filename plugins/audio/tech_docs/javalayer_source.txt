Javalayer is a low-level mp3 library licensed under the LGPL.

The jlayer build file doesn't have a clean target, so we have to add one ourselves:

  <target name="clean">
    <delete dir="classes" />
  </target>

The above target simply deletes the classes build directory. The build target doesn't attempt to build a classes directory, so we need to make it:

  <!-- Build -->
  <target name="build" depends="init">
    <echo message="------ Compiling application"/>
    <mkdir dir="classes" />
    <javac srcdir="${sources}" destdir="${classes}" includes="**"/>
    <copy todir="${classes}">
       <fileset dir="${sources}" >
           <include name="javazoom/jl/decoder/*.ser"/>
       </fileset>
     </copy>
  </target>


We do not want to fill up our source repository with useless file we can remove the 'doc' directory.. this frees up about 1.2 MB.
