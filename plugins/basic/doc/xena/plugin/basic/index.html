<h1>About the basic plugin</h1>

<p>The basic plugin is used to normalise binary files, this process is also known as XML wrapping or binary normalisation. The basic plugin also provides converters for the datetime, string and integer data formats, which are usually used when normalising datasets.</p>

<p>All computer files are binary data, so any file type can be normalised as a binary file. What this normalisation does is convert the file into a Base64 vesion of the data object, a reversible conversion that is commonly used by email programs, and then wraps it in XML containing metadata about the file. This is a reversible conversion, which means that it is possible to reproduce the original bitstream of the file from the XML wrapped version, which is not possible with a normalised version. 

<p>XML wrapping serves two purposes in the preservation process. The first is that Xena may be unable to normalise a particular data format because the plugin for that format does not exist. The second is that you may wish to preserve the original bitstream of a file in addition to normalising it. The main purpose of this is to enable a file to be normalised again if there is any question over the normalised version's authenticity.</p>
