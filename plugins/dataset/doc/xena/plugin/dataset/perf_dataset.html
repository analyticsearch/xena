<h1>How to view a normalised dataset</h1>

<p>Xena uses the dataset plugin to view normalised datasets. This is part of the basic Xena application.</p>

<p>To view an dataset that has been normalised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <em>Xena</em>.
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Open</em>.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, select the normalised dataset that you wish to view, and click on <em>Open</em>.
   <br>Xena will display the dataset using the default table view.
</ol>

<p>The dataset package view has several sub views. The default is the <em>Table</em> view. You can also select <em>Form</em> and <em>Properties</em> views. To change between the various sub-views:</p> 

<ol>
<li>From the <em>Window</em> menu, select <em>Change View</em>.
   <br>The <em>Change View</em> window will open.
   <br><img src="dataset_change_view.jpg">
<li>Select the current view under <em>Package View</em>.
   <br>In the example above that is the <em>Table View</em>.
<li>Select the desired sub-view from the drop down list at the bottom of the <em>Change View</em> window, and click <em>OK</em>.
</ol>

<p>The <em>Table</em> view displays the data as a data table. You can rearrange the data in the display by clicking on the column headings. This will sort the data by data order in that column.</p>

<p>The <em>Form</em> view displays the data as a series of pages, one page for each entry in the dataset, in the same interface as a multipage document. To view the individual entries, move between the pages by clicking on the buttons. The <em>First</em> button displays the first page of the package. The <em>Last</em> button moves to the final page of the package. The <em>Previous</em> and <em>Next</em> buttons move to the previous and next pages. If you wish to go to a particular page, type the number in the <em>Page</em> box and press <em>Enter</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Properties</em> view displays the properties of the different columns in the dataset.</p>

<p>You can also view the dataset as Raw XML or an XML Tree. See <em>Change View</em> under <em>Xena Menus</em> - <em>The Window Menu</em> for details on how to do this.</p>


<h2><a name="view_dataset">View menu options</a></h2>
<p>The View menu provides options for the current view of the current document. The options available under the View menu depend on the type of document that Xena is displaying, and the view of that document that you have chosen. The view menu has no options when viewing normalised datasets.</p>
