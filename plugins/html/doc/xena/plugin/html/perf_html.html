<h1>How to view a normalised HTML document</h1>

<p>Xena uses the HTML plugin to view normalised HTML documents. This plugin is part of the basic Xena application.</p>

<p>To view an HTML document that has been normalised:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open <em>Xena</em>
<li>From the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Open</em>.
<li>Using the <em>Open</em> window, select the normalised document that you wish to view and click on <em>Open</em>.
   <br>Xena will display the HTML document. 
<li>At the top of the display window is a <em>Show in Browser Window</em> button. Clicking on this button will open the document in your default HTML browser
</ol>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> Any images will not be displayed because the HTML normaliser only normalises the HTML file itself, not the images.</p>

<p>While the inbuilt viewer for normalised HTML documents in Xena shows the textual content of document being displayed, it can lose some formatting information. Viewing the document in an HTML browser will display this information and so is a preferable view.</p>

<p>You can also view the document as Raw XML or as an XML Tree. See <em>Change View</em> under <em>Xena Menus</em> - <em>The Window Menu</em> for details on how to do this.</p>


<h2>View menu options</h2>
<p>The View menu provides options for the current view of the current document. The options available under the View menu will depend on the type of document that Xena is displaying, and the view of that document that you have chosen. The view menu has no options when viewing normalised HTML documents.</p>
