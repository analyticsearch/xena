========

Bug Fixes
---------
* The default unwrapper was not handling nested content correctly, but has 
now been fixed.
* Files not relative to the base path are now stored as filename only.
* Close stream handles so that files can be deleted immediately on Windows.
* Refactor image viewer.
* Ensure that none of the fit views can scale over 100%.


New Features
------------
* Added ability to use Xena from the command line (provided by Matt from Archives NZ).
* Update included FLAC binary to 1.2.1.
* Added xlw as an extension for Excel files.
