Xena 4.2
========

Bug Fixes
---------
* Files not relative to the base path stored as filename only.
* Close stream handles so that files can be deleted immediately on Windows.
* "Fit To Size" is now default view and removed "Fit To Both" option.
* Fixed "Fit To Height" and "Fit To Width".
* Ensure that none of the fit views can scale over 100%.


New Features
------------
* Added ability to use Xena from the command line (provided by Matt from Archives NZ).
* Update included FLAC binary to 1.2.1.
