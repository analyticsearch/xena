Xena is released under the General Public License version 2. A full copy of this license can be found in the accompanying file, 'COPYING'.

Requirements
------------
To run this pre-compiled version of Xena you will require Sun's Java Runtime Environment 1.6, which is available at http://java.com.
Xena can also be compiled using the open source Java stack, OpenJDK (http://openjdk.org).

Run Xena
--------
The Xena program is called 'xena.jar' and you should be able to start it by either executing the script for your operating system ('xena.bat' for Windows or 'xena.sh' for Linux and other Unix variants).

Or you can run Xena manually with:
  java -jar xena.jar

This should kick up the program.

Please note that if running the script under Linux, first ensure that it is executable with:
  chmod a+x xena.sh

Have fun!

Run Xena Viewer
---------------
Xena files you create will be 'plain text' XML files, with the metadata and content of the original file stored in Base64 encoding.

Use any text editor to view the content of the Xena file itself (XML). To view and extract the original or normalised content stored in the Xena files you have created, use the Xena Viewer.

To start the Xena Viewer, simply run the respective execution script for your operating system, similar to the Xena instructions above.

Else, you can start it by running:
  java -cp xena.jar au.gov.naa.digipres.xena.viewer.ViewerMainFrame $1

For Windows, run:
  java -cp xena.jar au.gov.naa.digipres.xena.viewer.ViewerMainFrame %1
