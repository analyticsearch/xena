This directory contains the 3rd party jar files used by this plugin.

We should only be using a jar file for testing or because we cannot build the 3rd party jar from source! As we do not want to store BLOBS in the repository.

Building the OpenOffice.org UNO jar files doesn't compile easily so the jar files are stored the jar folder for the time being:
	juh.jar
	jurt.jar
	officebean.jar
	ridl.jar
	sandbox.jar
	unoil.jar

xt20051206.jar fails to build, but we do have a copy of the source code. So this jar file must be kept here.
