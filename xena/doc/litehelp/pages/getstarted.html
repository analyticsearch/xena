<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Before using Xena 3.0 Lite, a couple of simple initial settings must be made. These are found via Xena Lite's <b>Tools</b> menu.
</p>
<p>The location where files are to be stored after the conversion process must be specified. It is also useful to set up a location for Xena's log file.
</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org must be installed if Xena is to normalise files such as word processed documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Xena Lite uses a <b>2.0.x</b> version of OpenOffice.org, which may be downloaded from <b>http://download.openoffice.org</b>.
</p>
<p>If OpenOffice.org is not installed, Xena will binary normalise these files.</p>
